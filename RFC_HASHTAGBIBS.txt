Abstract

   *hashtagbibs* (or simply: *'bibs'*) are tiny tags, allowing mere
   mortals to connect words to other words using pencil, voice or
   keyboard.
   They allow *polyglot tagging* by expanding into multiple (reversed)
   BibTags (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX), JSON or XML snippets.

   For example, using OCR, scanned paper can now easily 'connect' with
   online graphs.
   Think of it as the brother of hashtags: a command for tagging-this-
   with-that.

   The goal of this spec is three-fold:

   *  specify bibs: a plaintext polyglot tag (DSL) which expands into
      various languages
   *  specify bibs as URI fragment: a way to hint browsers to filter a
      document on certain tag(s)
   *  specify bibrulers: to specify bibtags microformats like visual-
      meta (https://visual-meta.info)

1.  What are bibs

   <img src="postit.jpg" style="max-width:400px"/>

   bibs allow non-technical humans to specify: *THIS POINTS TO THAT*. In
   other words: compressed (reversed) BibTags, JSON or XML like so:

   John please get out the laundry

   #laundry@chores@todo

   |  This basically means:

   *  laundry points to chores and todo

   |  Or put in another way: laundry is tagged *tag* laundry and *tag*
   |  chores

   and expands into the following formats:

BibTeX             JSON                                   XML
======             ====                                   ===

@john{john}        { "tag":"john",   "match":"john"}        <tag name="john" match="john"/>

@chores{laundry}   { "tag":"chores", "match":"laundry"}   <tag name="chores" match="laundry"/>

@todo{laundry}     { "tag":"todo",   "match": "laundry"}    <tag name="todo" match="laundry"/>

   |  the word and john laundry can now be highlighted in the human text
   |  (or 3D object can be shown when their objectname matches). bibs
   |  are basically one step up from socialmedia hashtags, allowing mere
   |  mortals to connect words to other things using pencil, voice or
   |  keyboard.

   Bibs generalizes the BibTex author/title-semantics (author{title})
   into *this* points to *that* (this{that}).
   There's no precise predicates or properties, just simply 'this points
   to that', which empowers citizen annotation (an essential precursor
   of RDF).

   |  NOTE: in the rest of this article, we use focus on BibTex for
   |  convenience (as it is the most terse, easiest to write/repair/
   |  speak outputformat).

1.1.  format

   *  #<textpattern>[@tag[@anothertag[...]]]

   |  syntactically, bibs are hashtags with (concatenated) emaildomains
   |  without an extension

     +==================+===========================================+
     | language         | example                                   |
     +==================+===========================================+

   1.  to qualify as a bib, a word should start with a hashtag, and
       (optionally) contain on or more @ characters
   2.  last bib wins: overlapping bibs overwrite eachother (last tag(s)
       win)
   3.  spaces are not allowed, maximum by using + to represents spaces
       (the+bill@todo e.g.)

   #great+gatsby@book@readinglist
   #great+gatsby@book

   would only expand to:

   @book{great+gatsby

   }

2.  hashtagbib mimetypes

     +============================+=======================+==========+
     | mimetype                   | expand bibs to format | hides in |
     |                            |                       | document |
     +============================+=======================+==========+
     | text/plain;charset=utf-    | BibTex                | any      |
     | 8;bib=^@                   |                       | BibTex   |
     +----------------------------+-----------------------+----------+
     | text/plain;charset=utf-    | JSON                  | any JSON |
     | 8;bib=^{                   |                       |          |
     +----------------------------+-----------------------+----------+
     | text/plain;charset=utf-    | HTML                  | any HTML |
     | 8;bib=^<                   |                       |          |
     +----------------------------+-----------------------+----------+

                                  Table 2

   This mimetype indicates that bibs and their expanded format occuring
   in plain text, are automatically hidden and expanded by browsers.

   |  For example bib=^@ means that:

   1.  lines matching regex ^@ (BibTex) will not be rendered verbatim by
       default, in order for software to:
   2.  expand bibs (starting with a hashtag) to BibTex

   *  automatically create/detect links between textual/spatial objects
      within the document (see XR Fragments (https://xfragment.org))
   *  detect opiniated bibtag microformats (visual-meta (https://visual-
      meta.info) e.g.)

   |  This significantly expands expressiveness and portability of human
   |  tagged text, by *postponing machine-concerns to the end of the
   |  human text* in contrast to literal interweaving of content and
   |  markupsymbols (like markdown/HTML/XML/JSON etc)

3.  Example: extra properties

   Properties are not the scope of bibs, as bibs are a *one-way-street*
   (from bibs to X).
   However, its output can be further decorated with properties using
   the following notation:

   BibTeX             JSON                XML
   ======             ====                ===

   @john{john,        { "tag":"john",     <tag name="john"
     note={foo}         "match":"john",        match="john"
   }                    "note:"foo"            note="foo"/>
                      }

3.1.  Example: an textual kanban using tags

   buy milk
   finish paper
   contact John
   buy the great gatsby

   #milk@todo
   #contact@doing
   #contact@done
   #gatsby@done
   #finish+paper@doing

   If this text would be written on a paper, it could be scanned by a
   computer and represented spatially like so:

              +==========+==================+==============+
              | todo     | doing            | done         |
              +==========+==================+==============+
              | buy milk | finish paper     | contact John |
              +----------+------------------+--------------+
              |          | buy great gatsby |              |
              +----------+------------------+--------------+

   |  One could argue that tagging a word like buy would create
   |  conflicts, but for most purposes this is really easy to spot /
   |  workaround.  For serious, large bodies of text use (unique)
   |  expanded BibTags instead.

3.2.  Example javascript bibs expander

   Tiny but powerful implications:

expandBibs = (text) => {
    let bibs   = { regex: /(#[a-zA-Z0-9_+@\-]+(#)?)/g, tags: {}}
    text.replace( bibs.regex , (m,k,v) => {
       tok   = m.substr(1).split("@")
       match = tok.shift()
       if( tok.length ) tok.map( (t) => bibs.tags[t] = `@${t}{${match},\n}` )
       else if( match.substr(-1) == '#' )
          bibs.tags[match] = `@{${match.replace(/#/,'')}}`
       else bibs.tags[match] = `@${match}{${match},\n}`
    })
    return text.replace( bibs.regex, '') + Object.values(bibs.tags).join('\n')
}

t = expandBibs(`john, could you feed the cat?

  #john
  #laundry@chores@todo
  #some-scope#
`)

   BibTeX OUTPUT:

    john, could you feed the cat?


    @john{john,
    }
    @chores{laundry,
    }
    @todo{laundry,
    }
    @{some-scope}

3.3.  Bibs & BibTeX combo: lowest common denominator for linking data

   Eventhough Bibs can expand to JSON and XML as well, it's worth noting
   that Bibs & BibTex are closest to human thought:

   Unlike XML or JSON, BibTex is typeless, unnested, and uncomplicated,
   hence a great advantage for introspection.
   It's a missing, lowbarrier, sensemaking precursor to extrospective
   RDF.

   |  "When a car breaks down, the ones *without* turbosupercharger are
   |  easier to fix"

   BibTeX-appendices are already used in the digital AND physical world
   (academic books, visual-meta (https://visual-meta.info)), perhaps due
   to its terseness & simplicity.
   In that sense, it's one step up from the .ini fileformat (which has
   never leaked into the physical world like BibTex):

   1.  <b id="frictionless-copy-paste">frictionless copy/pasting</b> (by
       humans) of (unobtrusive) content AND metadata
   2.  an introspective 'sketchpad' for metadata, which can (optionally)
       mature into RDF later

3.4.  Merging (BibTagged) overlaps

   When a bib (#great+gatsby@book is copy-pasted into another document
   (a PDF or Textfile with a visual-meta (https://visual-meta.info)
   appendix e.g.):

   1.  the editor should check for the existence of @book{great+gatsby

   2.  if exist: do nothing, leave target document as is
   3.  if not: create the expanded BibTag
   4.  optionally, the editor can offer to add properties (as bibs are
       propertyless)

   |  propertyless bibs, are a great way as a 'process later'-medium ("I
   |  wrote down great+gatsby@readinglist on a papertowel/email, to
   |  scan/copy-paste it later)

4.  What are bibs in a URI fragment

   Just like regular URI Fragments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   URI_fragment) they hint the browser to focus anything (Bib)Tagged:

   *  https://website.com#@chores@todo
   *  https://mastodon.io/myprofile/#@chores@todo
   *  ://xrworld.org/3dscene.gltf#@chores@todo

   |  Format: #@<bibtag>[ + @<bibtag> + [ ... ] ]

5.  Rulers (microformats)

   The following allows for microformats:

   Apples, cinnamon, sugar and dough make a great applepie.

   #recipe-start#
   #applepie@todo
   #recipe-stop#

   expands into the following:

BibTex             JSON                                HTML
======             ====                                ====

${recipe-start}    { "ruler":"recipe-start" }          <ruler name="recipe-start"/>
@todo{applepie,    { "tag":"todo", "match":applepie"}  <tag name="todo" match="applepie"/>

}
${recipe-stop}     { "ruler":"recipe-stop" }           <ruler name="recipe-stop"/>

   BibTex rulers have been pioneered by the visual-meta (https://visual-
   meta.info) microformat as a means of organizing BibTags:

   @{visual-meta-start}
   @{visual-meta-header-start}
   @visual-meta{
    version = {1.1},
    generator = {Author 7.6.2 (1064)},
   }
   @{visual-meta-header-end}
   @{visual-meta-bibtex-self-citation-start}
   @book{2021-12-08T10:57:03Z/TheFutureo,
   author = {Frode Alexander Hegland},
   editor = {Frode Alexander Hegland},
   title = {The Future of Text ||},
   ...

   Eventhough it looks like 'nested data', this snippet would actually
   get decoded to this unnested array:

[
  { ruler: `{visual-meta-start}` },
  { ruler: `{visual-meta-header-start}` },
  { k: "visual-meta", v: { version: "1.1", generator: "Author 7.6.2 1064)" } }
  { ruler: `{visual-meta-header-end}` },
  { ruler: `{visual-meta-bibgtex-self-citation-start}` },
  { k: "book{2021-12-08T10:56:03Z/TheFutureo", v: { author: "Frode ...", ... } }
  ...
]

   Why not a nested tree-structure?  This kneejerk reaction should
   always be considered 'a temporary option'.
   Don't forget that Bibrulers are simply rulers (not blocks):

   1.  don't try to re-invent XML or JSON
   2.  don't promote traversing graphs (instead: just a list with tags)
   3.  they promote rather dumb, unnested, streamable lists (unlike
       HTML/XML/JSON) adhering to JSONLines/CSV
   4.  they are much faster/simpler to lookup, implement, (de)serialize
       across low- and highlevel languages.
