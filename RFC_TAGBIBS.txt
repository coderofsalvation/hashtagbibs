Abstract

   Tagbibs (or simply: 'bibs') are tiny paper/voice-friendly tags, which
   expand into multiple BibTags (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX).
   Using OCR, they're great for connecting scanned paper with online
   graphs.
   But also using voice-recognition or Text in XR.
   Think of it as the brother of hashtags: a command for tagging-this-
   with-that.
   The goal of this spec is three-fold:

   *  specify bibs: a terse tagdescription which expands into a reversed
      BibTag
   *  specify bibs as URI fragment: a way to hint browsers to jump to
      (bib)tagged content
   *  specify bibrulers: dumb line-based separators for bibtags

1.  What are tagbibs

   <img src="postit.jpg" style="max-width:400px"/>

   bibs allow non-technical humans to write reversed BibTags in a short-
   form (on paper):

   Please get out the laundry

   @laundry@chores@todo

   These bibs basically tag 'laundry' with 'chores' and 'todo', by
   expanding into the following BibTags:

   Please get out the laundry

   @chores{laundry,

   }
   @todo{laundry,

   }

   |  the word laundry can now be highlighted in the human text. bibs
   |  are basically one step up from socialmedia hashtags, allowing mere
   |  mortals to connect words to other words using pencil or keyboard.

   There's no precise predicates or properties (just 'this points to
   that', which empowers citizen annotation (an essential precursor of
   RDF).

1.1.  format

   *  @<word>[@tag[@anothertag[...]]]

   |  syntactically, bibs are (concatenated) emaildomains without an
   |  extension

   +==================+================================================+
   | language         | example                                        |
   +==================+================================================+
   | javascript       | /(@[a-zA-Z0-9_+]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_@]+)/g            |
   | regex            |                                                |
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+
   | shell grep       | cat textwithbibs.txt | grep -oE '(@[a-zA-      |
   |                  | Z0-9_+]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_@]+)'                      |
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+
   | shell awk        | cat textwithbibs.txt | xargs -n1 | awk '/(@[a- |
   |                  | zA-Z0-9_+]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_@]+)/ { print $0 }'     |
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   1.  at least @ characters need to occur, to qualify as a bib
   2.  last bib wins: overlapping bibs overwrite eachother (last tag(s)
       win)
   3.  spaces are not allowed, maximum by using + to represents spaces
       (the+bill@todo e.g.)

   great+gatsby@book@readinglist
   great+gatsby@book

   would only expand to:

   @book{great+gatsby

   }

1.2.  Example: an textual kanban using tags

Internet-Draft                   tagbibs                  September 2023


   buy milk
   finish paper
   contact John
   buy the great gatsby

   @milk@todo
   @contact@doing
   @contact@done
   @gatsby@done
   @finish+paper@doing

   If this text would be written on a paper, it could be scanned by a
   computer and represented spatially like so:

              +==========+==================+==============+
              | todo     | doing            | done         |
              +==========+==================+==============+
              | buy milk | finish paper     | contact John |
              +----------+------------------+--------------+
              |          | buy great gatsby |              |
              +----------+------------------+--------------+

                                 Table 2

   |  One could argue that tagging a word like buy would create
   |  conflicts, but for most purposes this is really easy to spot /
   |  workaround.  For serious, large bodies of text use (unique)
   |  expanded BibTags instead.

1.3.  Example javascript bibs expander

var bibs   = { regex: /(@[a-zA-Z0-9_+]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_@]+)/g, tags: {}}
text.replace( bibs.regex , (m,k,v) => {
   tok   = m.substr(1).split("@")
   match = tok.shift()
   tok.map( (t) => bibs.tags[match] = `@${t}{${match},\n}\n` )
})
text = Object.values(bibs.tags).join('\n') + bibtex.replace( bibs.regex, '')

   |  Tiny but powerful

1.4.  Merging (BibTagged) overlaps

   When a bib (great+gatsby@book is copy-pasted into another document (a
   PDF or Textfile with a visual-meta (https://visual-meta.info)
   appendix e.g.):

   1.  the editor should check for the existence of @book{great+gatsby

Internet-Draft                   tagbibs                  September 2023


   2.  if exist: do nothing, leave target document as is
   3.  if not: create the expanded BibTag
   4.  optionally, the editor can offer to add properties (as bibs are
       propertyless)

   |  propertyless bibs, are a great way as a 'process later'-medium ("I
   |  wrote down great+gatsby@readinglist on a papertowel/email, to
   |  scan/copy-paste it later)

2.  What are bibs in a URI fragment

   Just like regular URI Fragments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   URI_fragment) they hint the browser to focus anything (Bib)Tagged:

   *  https://website.com#@chores@todo
   *  https://mastodon.io/myprofile/#@chores@todo
   *  ://xrworld.org/3dscene.gltf#@chores@todo

   |  Format: #@<bibtag>[ + @<bibtag> + [ ... ] ]

3.  What are bibrulers

   Bibrulers are linebased separators, used by visual-meta
   (https://visual-meta.info) as a means of organizing BibTags:

   @{visual-meta-start}
   @{visual-meta-header-start}
   @visual-meta{
    version = {1.1},
    generator = {Author 7.6.2 (1064)},
   }
   @{visual-meta-header-end}
   @{visual-meta-bibtex-self-citation-start}
   @book{2021-12-08T10:57:03Z/TheFutureo,
   author = {Frode Alexander Hegland},
   editor = {Frode Alexander Hegland},
   title = {The Future of Text ||},
   ...

   This snippet would get decoded to this unnested array:

[
  { ruler: `@{visual-meta-start}` },
  { ruler: `@{visual-meta-header-start}` },
  { tag: "@visual-meta", props: { version: "1.1", generator: "Author 7.6.2 1064)" } }
  { ruler: `@{visual-meta-bibgtex-self-citation-start}` },
  { tag: "@book{2021-12-08T10:56:03Z/TheFutureo", ..... }
  ...
]

   Why not a nested tree-structure?  This kneejerk reaction should
   always be considered 'a last option'.

   |  Bibrulers don't try to re-invent XML, they are rather promoting
   |  dumb, unnested lists, which are much faster/simpler to traverse &
   |  implement in all languages.
