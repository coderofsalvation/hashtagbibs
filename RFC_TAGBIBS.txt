Abstract

   Tagbibs are tiny paperfriendly tags, which expand into multiple
   BibTags (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX).
   Using OCR, they're great for connecting scanned paper with online
   graphs.
   The goal of this spec is three-fold:

   *  specify tagbibs: a terse tagdescription which expands into a
      reversed BibTag
   *  specify tagbibs URI fragments: a way to hint browsers to jump to
      (bib)tagged content
   *  specify bibrulers: dumb line-based separators for bibtags

2.  What are tagbibs

   <img src="postit.jpg" style="max-width:400px"/>

   tagbibs allow non-technical humans to write reversed BibTags in a
   short-form (on paper):

   Please get out the laundry

   @laundry@chores@todo

   These tagbibs basically tag 'laundry' by expanding into the following
   BibTags:

   Please get out the laundry

   @chores{laundry,

   }
   @todo{laundry,

   }

   |  tagbibs are basically one step up from socialmedia hashtags,
   |  allowing mere mortals to connect words to other words using pencil
   |  or keyboard.

   There's no precise predicates or properties, which empowers citizen
   annotation (an essential precursor of RDF).

   *  format: @sometag[@anothertag[@...]]

   |  syntactically, tagbibs are (concatenated) emaildomains without an
   |  extension

   *  javascript regex: /(@[a-zA-Z0-9_@]+)[^ \n]?/
   *  shell: cat textwithtagbibs.txt | xargs -n1 | awk '/(@[a-zA-
      Z0-9_@]+)[^ \n]?/ { print $0 }'

3.  What are tagbibs fragments

   Just like regular URI Fragments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   URI_fragment) they hint the browser to focus anything (Bib)Tagged:

   *  https://website.com#@chores@todo
   *  https://mastodon.io/myprofile/#@chores@todo
   *  ://3dworld.gltf#@chores@todo

   |  Format: #@<bibtag>[ + @<bibtag> + [ ... ] ]

4.  What are bibrulers

   Bibrulers are linebased separators, used by visual-meta
   (https://visual-meta.info) as a means of organizing BibTags:

   @{visual-meta-start}
   @{visual-meta-header-start}
   @visual-meta{
    version = {1.1},
    generator = {Author 7.6.2 (1064)},
   }
   @{visual-meta-header-end}
   @{visual-meta-bibtex-self-citation-start}
   @book{2021-12-08T10:57:03Z/TheFutureo,
   author = {Frode Alexander Hegland},
   editor = {Frode Alexander Hegland},
   title = {The Future of Text ||},
   ...

   This snippet would get decoded to this unnested array:

[
  { ruler: `@{visual-meta-start}` },
  { ruler: `@{visual-meta-header-start}` },
  { tag: "@visual-meta", props: { version: "1.1", generator: "Author 7.6.2 1064)" } }
  { ruler: `@{visual-meta-bibgtex-self-citation-start}` },
  { tag: "@book{2021-12-08T10:56:03Z/TheFutureo", ..... }
  ...
]

   Why not a nested tree-structure?  This kneejerk reaction should
   always be considered 'a last option'.

   |  Bibrulers don't try to re-invent XML, they are rather promoting
   |  dumb, unnested lists, which are much faster/simpler to traverse &
   |  implement in all languages.
