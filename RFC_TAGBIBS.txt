Abstract

   Tagbibs are tiny paperfriendly tags, which expand into multiple
   BibTags (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX).  Using OCR, they're
   great for connecting scanned paper with online graphs.  The goal of
   this document is twofold:

   *  specify tagbibs: a terse tagdescription which expands into a
      reversed BibTag
   *  specify tagbibs URI fragments: a way to hint browsers to jump to
      (bib)tagged content
   *  specify bibrulers: dumb line-based separators for bibtags

1.  What are tagbibs

   <img src="postit.jpg" style="max-width:400px"/>

   tagbibs allow non-technical humans to write reversed BibTags in a
   short-form (on paper):

   Please get out the laundry

   @laundry@chores@todo

   These tagbibs basically tag 'laundry' by expanding into the following
   BibTags:

   Please get out the laundry

   @chores{laundry,

   }
   @todo{laundry,

   }

   |  tagbibs are basically one step up from socialmedia hashtags,
   |  allowing mere mortals to tag things with pencil or keyboard.

   There's no precise predicates or properties, which allows citizen
   annotation (an essential precursor of RDF).
